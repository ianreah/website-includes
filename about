<div class="page-header"><h2>About</h2></div>

<p>I work as a Software Developer at <a href='http://nonlinear.com/'>Nonlinear Dynamics Limited</a>, a developer of proteomics and metabolomics software.</p>

<p>My day job mainly involves developing Windows desktop applications with C# .NET.</p>

<p>My hobby/spare-time development tends to focus on playing around with some different technologies (which, at the minute seems to be web application development with JavaScript).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s this hobby/spare-time development that you&#8217;re most likely to read about here.</p>
